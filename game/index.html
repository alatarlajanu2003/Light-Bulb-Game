                <p id = "descriptionP"> Light bulbs can only be placed above white tiles.
                    The light from the light bulbs does not spread diagonally, only straight along the given row and column.
                    The black tiles have objects placed on them, which block the propagation of light.
                    Black cells can optionally contain an integer from 0 to 4. This indicates how many adjacent (bottom, top, right, left) cells contain light bulbs. If there is such a number, the puzzle must be solved accordingly!
                    Two light bulbs can NEVER illuminate each other!
                    The goal of the game is to place the light bulbs so that all the white tiles are illuminated.
                    The game is played by one player until he solves the puzzle, so there is no need to manage multiple players at the same time or divide into rounds.</p>
